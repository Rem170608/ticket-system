## Installation & Setup


### Prerequisites
Before you start, make sure you have installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (comes with npm)
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/)
- A database (e.g., MySQL) if required by your setup
- A local web server (XAMPP, WAMP, or PHP built-in server)


### Steps


1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rem170608/ticket-system.git
cd ticket-system
```


2. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```


3. **Setup backend (PHP):**
- Place the backend files inside your PHP serverâ€™s root directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
- Make sure PHP is running (via XAMPP, WAMP, or `php -S localhost:8000`).


4. **Run frontend (Node.js):**
```bash
npm run dev
```


5. **Access the application:**
- Frontend: `http://localhost:3000` (or the port configured in your setup)
- Backend: served via your PHP server (e.g., `http://localhost:8000` or `http://localhost/ticket-system`)


ðŸ‘‰ Note: Database setup instructions are not included yet. If your implementation requires one, you will need to create and configure it manually.
